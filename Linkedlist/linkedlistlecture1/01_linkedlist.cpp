// linked list is the data structure in which store elements in non - contiguous manner also
// so as a result there is less memory wastage
// linked list in real world - OS ke andar storage management ke andar linked list ka use kaha par aata

// Types of Linked Lists
// 	1.	Singly Linked List (SLL):
// 	•	Each node has two parts:
// 	1.	Data: Stores the value.
// 	2.	Next: A pointer/reference to the next node.
// 	•	Traversal is unidirectional (head → tail).
// 	2.	Doubly Linked List (DLL):
// 	•	Each node has three parts:
// 	1.	Data: Stores the value.
// 	2.	Next: A pointer/reference to the next node.
// 	3.	Prev: A pointer/reference to the previous node.
// 	•	Traversal is bidirectional (head ↔ tail).
// 	3.	Circular Linked List (CLL):
// 	•	The last node points back to the first node, forming a loop.
// 	•	Can be singly or doubly linked.
// 	4.	Doubly Circular Linked List:
// 	•	Combines features of DLL and CLL, where both ends are connected, and traversal is possible in both directions.
