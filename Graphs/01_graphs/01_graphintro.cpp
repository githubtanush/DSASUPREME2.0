//what is Graph ? -  Graph is a combination of edges and nodes.
// Graph is like tree you feel the vibe of tree in graph 
//nodes can store different types of data like integer, string , character or boolean 
//edges are of two types - 1.) directed edge
// 2.) undirected edge 
// practical application - google maps / facebook map or any other networking aap
//edge with a weight - edges ke upar agr weight likha hua hai to usko weighted graph kehte hai 
// cyclic graph - jis node se shuru hua usi node par end ho gya
// acyclic graph - jis node se shuru hua us node par end nhi hua
// degree - ek node jitne se connected ho that is called degree and degree concept contains 
// in only unweighted graph.
// degree 2 types ki hoti hai - indegree and outdegree but yeh concept aata hai directed graph mein
// arrow kisi node mein aata hua hoga that is called indegree.
// arrow kisi node se jata hua hoga that is called outdegree.
//valid path - which does not contain cycle simply we say when we not return to starting node
// is called valid path 
// compenent - 
//          a                   a - b       - component 1
//         / \"                     |                            - components
//        b   c                     C
//                              d - e       - component 2
//                              b           - component 3
//                            disconnected graph
// Is every tree a graph - Yes 
// Is every graph a tree - No

// Interviews favourite questions 
//1.) clone a graph 
//2.)
